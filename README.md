For the purposes of learning to make a repository
Rambeling here, just trying to learn how this whole GitHub thing works. Did some Basic programming way back in the day and then went into the Human Services field. Think I'm ready for a change and have been taking some Data Science classes. Hopefully I'm not too old to get back into this intense computer stuff.
